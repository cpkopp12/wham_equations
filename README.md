## Installation

Just download the python modules and load your own data into them!

  

## Usage

  

Download the modules. The data generator module can be used to create test data for testing the convergence algorithm module or to test your own convergence algorithms! The convergence algorithm module can be used to generate probability distributions for your own biased MD simulations!

  

## Credits

All of the math regarding the WHAM equations and advice on convergence stability came from the following paper:
J Comput Chem. 2012 February 5; 33(4): 453â€“465. doi:10.1002/jcc.21989.
Convergence and error estimation in free energy calculations using the weighted histogram analysis method
